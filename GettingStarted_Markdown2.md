<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>These are my extensions that I have added to VSCode.  I have<br>a lot more extensions, and the ones for this class were not shown<br>in a row.  I decided to concatenate the images of extensions for<br>this class instead of sending a screenshot of all 26 of my extensions<br>(a lot of them being for C++ development).  In addition, when I<br>tried using the snippet screenshot tool to copy and paste, it was not<br>working.  So I just made a google drive shareable link to my<br>screenshots for this homework assignment.<br></p>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this module, anything interesting, new, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned a lot of things due to the fact that I am<br>fairly new to internet app development.  I have tried this stuff in<br>the past, but I was discouraged because of the tedious set up (I<br>tried to learn Angular).  However, from the really steady and slow pace<br>of the first couple weeks of class, I learned how to set up<br>a database connection through mySQL (which will be helpful for CS331), all of<br>the command line basics (though I still need to get used to them),<br>and eTheRealLab&#39;s homework deliverable page (which I also need to get used to).<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I don&#39;t think I had any issues, as when I followed class, things<br>went rather well.  If I missed a step, it was obvious that<br>I did, and so I just had to rewatch the setup videos. <br>The only &quot;issue&quot; I can think of was following along during class. <br>I would eventually lag behind and miss a step, and while I tried<br>to catch up on the step, I would miss the steps after it<br>as well. <br></p><br></td></tr>
